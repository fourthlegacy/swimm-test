<!-- Intro - Do not remove this comment -->
Hi! So, here's the deal. Here at {{COMPANY.NAME}} we love utility-first CSS, so Tailwind is our go-to. If you're coming from a MaterialUI (or other design systems like CSS-in-JS, etc.), this should hopefully give you an idea of what Tailwind even is, how it works, and how to get started with our custom design token system.

Have fun!
