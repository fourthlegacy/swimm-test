title: How We Do Data Fetching
file_version: 1.1.1

To explain our data fetching, let's take a look at `ðŸ“„ ChatFeed.tsx`.

First, we define a deferred mutation using SWR.

<br/>

We use SWR's `useMutation` hook to define remote mutations that are **ONLY** triggered manually. This means you can call the trigger function later with the message object whenever needed. The `isMutating` is a boolean value that indicates the current status of the mutation. Very handy, as we'll soon see!

### ðŸ“„ ChatFeed.tsx
```tsx
1       const {
2          error,
3          trigger,
4          isMutating,
5        } = useSWRMutation('/api/message', createMessage)
```
