This is a mouthful, but it is exactly what it says on the tin. You chain together multiple class names, all of which contain prebuilt snippets of CSS.

<br/>

Just a custom Link component that uses `next/link` and uses Tailwind classes for styling!
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ components/Link.tsx
```tsx
2      const Link = (props: Props) => {
3        return (
4          <>
5            <Link href={`https://www.github.com/${message.user?.name}`}>
6              <span className="mb-2 cursor-pointer rounded-lg text-sm underline ">
7                {message.user?.name}
8              </span>
9            </Link>
10         </>
11       );
12     };
```

Don't worry, with Tailwind you're just writing CSS! Don't be intimidated by long class names!

We recommend you get the Tailwind IntelliSense plugin \[here\]([https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)) for autocomplete, linting, and hover previews.
