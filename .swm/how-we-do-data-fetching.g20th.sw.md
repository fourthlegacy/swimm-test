title: How We Do Data Fetching

To explain our data fetching, let's take a look at `ðŸ“„ ChatFeed.tsx`

1.  First, we define our deferred mutation operation.

<br/>

We use SWR's `useMutation` hook to define remote mutations that are **ONLY** triggered manually. This means you can call the trigger function later with the message object whenever needed. Also, `isMutating` is a boolean value the hook returns, that indicates the current status of the mutation. Very handy, as we'll see soon!

### ðŸ“„ ChatFeed.tsx
```tsx
1       const {
2          error,
3          trigger,
4          isMutating,
5        } = useSWRMutation('/api/message', createMessage)
```
